This project focuses on using Tableau to analyze four key areas:
1. Visualizing the number of individuals experiencing homelessness to highlight its scope.
2. Mapping the concentration of homelessness across states to identify the most affected areas.
3. Analyzing the impact on diverse population groups by race, gender, family structure, and veteran status.
4. Comparing housing demand with available shelter supply to identify resource gaps
 
The aims of this project are to:
1. Simplify the complexity of homelessness for better understanding.
2. Propose improvements to housing inventory to address the shelter shortage.
3. Highlight the disproportionate impact on marginalized groups and suggest equitable strategies.
